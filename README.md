# ValueDrivenAttentionalCapture

The experiment consists of two phases: a training phase (a two-armed bandit task) and a test phase (task similar to test phase from Anderson et al. 2011). In the training phase participants should learn certain associations between color and reward. In the second phase we test whether this reward values are associated with a task-irrelevant value-driven-attentional capture.
